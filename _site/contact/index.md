Additional contributions from Taxonomists, Mycologists, and those focusing on fungal genomics is encouraged and needed. We need the expertise and efforts of the entire community of fungal enthusiasts from scientists to amateurs to collect the materials in order to sample the 500+ recognized families of Fungi.  We also welcome the help and contributions of genome scientists interested in interpreting the results from the sequencing projects and comparative analyses.  Please contact Joey or Jason by email if you have an interest. In the coming months we will provide an interactive web resource to track the project involvement and which Families need help gathering materials.
